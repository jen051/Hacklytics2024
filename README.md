# Robotic Registers

## About
Moore Circuit Gen 1 (MCG-1) is a Graph GAN Deep Learning model that was trained on a set of over 50,000 existing digital logic circuits. It is capable of generating viable random digital logic circuits without discontinuities or improper connections.

## Model Use Case
The MCG-1 model could be extremely useful for those researching and developing technology centered around FPGA and ASIC development. The ability to generate a viable random circuit allows for a model that could be further trained to generate a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design from a much higher level circuit or description. If used properly, this technology could rapidly cut down on the production time associated with developing chips with Very Large Scale Integration that typically take years to produce as all gates must be hand placed to be packed into a small package.
